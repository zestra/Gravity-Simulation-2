# Gravity-Simulation-2
My Second and Latest Gravity Simulation, made for Al Bateen Academy, Aldar Academies, and one's self-satisfaction.

## Requirements
The program is based on the language Python, so you will need that. You will also require the [code]math[/code] and [code]pygame[/code] modules. It will be better if you make sure that you have the latest versions of these modules, just in case.

## Updates
I am proud to present to you Draft 2 of my Gravity Simulation 2!

But first, let me address a question I know you are dreading to be answered: why wasn't there an official release for Draft 1? Well, Draft 1 was fully completed on 7 Jan 2023, but the programmer, me, was too lazy to officially release it on Github. Also, the programmer appreciated that the simulation had a lack of variability and control, which would disgust the user and also the programmer themself. Thus they continued on to make Draft 2 without releasing Draft 1 officially, bringing the simulation to the next level.

Draft 2 introduces a whole brand new way of interacting with Gravity Simulations. First, there the simulation now has a cannon, which is surprising not very popular among all the gravity simulators. You can adjust the cannon's fire angle with the "Up" and "Down" keys. The user can also adjust the fire velocity of the cannonball with the "5" and "6" buttons on their keyboard. And of course, press the SPACE button to fire the cannonball. The cannon also has its own information box giving info on its settings and instructions on how to use it.

The cannonball's information box has also been updated to give information on not only the ball's velocity, angle, and position, etc, but also on it's initial velocity and angle, which enables mechanics students to do calculations and make predictions about the ball and its trajectory. The angle indicator has also been updated so that the arrow changes length to indicate the decrease or increase of the ball's velocity.

The cannonball itself has also been upgraded. Now, you can press the "7" button to freeze the ball in time, "8" to show or hide the trajectory the ball has traced, or the "9" button to delete the ball from the simulation. As you can have many balls in the simulation at the same time, you can switch between them and view their information or control them by pressing the LEFT and RIGHT buttons. These controls will also be listed in the cannonball's information box for whenever you need it.

Finally, there is a guide information box which allows you to hide or show the information boxes of the cannon and balls, so that you have more room for the cannonballs. There is also quadratic information box, which will allow you to input a quadratic and it will fire the ball so as to trace the quadratic's path! Unfortunately, I, the programmer, have to do some complicated algebra to allow this to happen, and so this feature is currently unavailable but will hopefully be in the near-future.

This is only a brief introduction to what Draft 2 offers, and a little bit of tinkering will allow you to reveal more of its incredible features. I hope you will enjoy this simulation as much as I do and did as I programmed it. If you liked this simulation, consider giving a shoutout, a star, and watch this repository for future updates.
